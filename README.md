# Sparta UI Testing

The task was to utilise the tool selenium WebDriver for chrome to create a set of automated test for the website <http://demoqa.com/registration/>. The webpage was a form that required various fields to be filled such as first, name, las name, username and password. 
## Setup 
- Once you access the GitHub repository you can obtain the files by either taking the repository clone link and running `git clone [insert clone link here]`.
- You can also obtain the files by directly downloading them from GitHub as a zip file.
- The group of files contain two folders, selenium\_class and selenium\_starter\_code. Both folders can be accessed to run different webdriver.
- The class folder has selenium_class.rb which can be edited to run the various method and then carry out the use of the webdriver for chrome.
- The starter code folder holds the selenium\_demoqa\_registation.rb file which with necesssary edits can also carry out the webdriver for chrome, however this folder contains test that are contained in an adjacent folder named spec. 
- The test contained within the spec can be run after entering selenium\_starter\_code folder and using the terminal to run `rspec` and the test will be carried out displaying the results.
